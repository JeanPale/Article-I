Let us consider a single cluster with radius $a$ irradiated by short intense femtosecond pulse. Assume an incident plane wave propagating along $z$ axis of cartesian coordinate system and polarized along $x$ axis.

The Drude model yields the dielectric function of the plasma with corresponding parameters. The Mie theory can be used for the description of elastic electromagnetic wave scattering in case of linear interactions and let us obtain scattered and internal field. A main step is to solve the scalar Helmholtz Equation and gain the vector solutions. For spherical cluster the solution of corresponding equation can be written in the form of spherical Bessel and Hankel functions of $n$-th order with corresponding coefficients.

Considering single cluster we can use zero-order approximation of Bessel functions if radius of the cluster is much less than wavelength. For values of normalized radius near $0.5$ it's still applicable, but for $ka \sim 1$ the approximation ceases to be reasonable already, particularly for large orders of vactor harmonics.

Instead, in this case, the first-order approximation is better suited. Here we can see how better this expansion --- exact solutions are much closer to the first-order than zero-.

Such approximations allow us to estimate the resonance cases for a material with pre-defined refractive index $m$ as well as estimate refractive index corresponding to the required wavelength.
